## 🤔 How You Can Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, and all are welcome!

* 🐞 **Reporting Bugs:** If you find something that isn't working as expected, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/nitinrc264/credx-ai/issues/new) and describe the bug with as much detail as possible.
* 💡 **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have a great idea? We want to hear it! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/nitinrc264/credx-ai/issues/new) to suggest a new feature or improvement.
* 📝 **Improving Documentation:** If you find parts of the `README.md` or other docs that are unclear, or if you want to add more examples, feel free to suggest changes.
* 🧑‍💻 **Working on New Features:** We have a list of ideas we'd love help with! This is a great place to start.

### 🚀 Feature Ideas (Where to Start)

We've already listed some "Future Improvements" in our `README.md`. These are fantastic places to pick up your first task:

* **Real-time job scraping:** Build a scraper (e.g., using Scrapy or BeautifulSoup) to pull in live jobs from a site like LinkedIn, Indeed, or others.
* **Cultural/Work-Style Matching:** Add new fields to the user profile and job data to match on things like "remote-first," "fast-paced startup," or "work-life balance."
* **Mobile-First Redesign:** Our current HTML/CSS is functional, but it could be much more responsive and accessible on mobile devices.
* **Code Cleanup:** As a hackathon project, some code could be refactored for clarity or performance.

## Getting Started: Your First Contribution

Ready to make a change? Here's the step-by-step process.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Follow the installation instructions from the `README.md` to get the project running locally.

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.

2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/credx-ai.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/credx-ai.git)
    cd credx-ai
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate it:**
    * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors pandas "sentence-transformers>=2.2.0" torch torchvision torchaudio PyMuPDF "google-generativeai>=0.3.0"
    ```

6.  **Add Your API Key:**
    * Open `app.py`.
    * Replace `API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual Google Gemini API key.

7.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    You should now be able to access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

* Look for issues labeled **"good first issue"** for tasks we've identified as great for new contributors.
* If you're working on one of the **"Future Improvements,"** please [open a new issue](https://github.com/nitinrc264/credx-ai/issues/new) first to let us know. This helps us avoid duplicated work.
* Once you're ready to start, assign the issue to yourself or leave a comment.

### Step 3: Make Your Changes (The Git Workflow)

1.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix. This keeps your changes organized.
    ```bash
    # Use a descriptive branch name
    git checkout -b feature/add-job-scraper
    # or
    git checkout -b fix/resume-parser-bug
    ```

2.  **Write your code!** Make your changes and test them locally to make sure everything still works.

3.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and concise message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add initial job scraping module"
    ```

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-job-scraper
    ```

2.  **Open a Pull Request** on the original `credx-ai` repository.

3.  In your PR description, please provide:
    * **A clear description** of what you changed.
    * **A link to the issue** it solves (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
    * **Any screenshots or GIFs** if you made changes to the UI.

We'll review your PR as soon as we can, provide feedback, and get it merged.

## 📂 A Quick Look at the Codebase

To help you find your way around, here's what the key files do:

* `app.py`: The main **Flask server**. This handles API routes and serves the frontend.
* `data_handler.py`: Responsible for loading and managing the `jobs.csv` file with Pandas.
* `matching_engine.py`: The core logic that combines all other modules to find and rank job matches.
* `resume_parser.py`: Uses `PyMuPDF` to read the uploaded PDF resume.
* `semantic_matcher.py`: Uses `sentence-transformers` to find semantically similar job titles.
* `skills_scorer.py`: Calculates the skill-based match score.
* `story_generator.py`: Uses the **Gemini API** to generate the personalized "Match Story."
* `templates/index.html`: The main frontend file.
* `static/`: Contains the `style.css` and `script.js` for the frontend.
